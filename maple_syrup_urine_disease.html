                    <p>
                        MSUD, also known as BCKD deficiency, is a protein enzyme deficiency in infants, which is known for causing victims’ urine to smell like maple syrup. It prevents infants from metabolizing a very common type of amino acid. This can lead to brain damage, comas and even respiratory failure within 10 days of infancy if gone untreated.

                    <h3>Effects & Symptoms</h3> <br/>
                    <p>
                        The disease’s symptoms are apparent several hours after birth, including strange motions and lethargy. The most notable, however, is the maple syrup odor in an infant’s urine. The lack of the BCKD enzyme can lead to metabolic intoxication, meaning that the disease can be extremely fatal to infants, or cause permanent developmental disorders.

                    <h3>Treatment</h3> <br/>
                    <p>
                        MSUD is not curable, however it is treatable. Treatment will have to take place over the course of the life of the individual in the form of therapy and metabolic examination, as well as dietary restrictions of certain proteins. Liver transplantation is an option for certain cases as well. Diagnosis should happen during infancy, in order to have the best chance of survival and least chance of permanent damage.
