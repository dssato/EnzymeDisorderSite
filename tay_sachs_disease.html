                    <p>
                        What is Tay-sachs? Tay-Sachs is a rare, inherited disorder in which a fatty substance in the brain destroys nerve cells, the spinal cord and the brain itself.

                    <h3>Affected People</h3> <br/>
                    <p>
                        Commonly Tay-Sachs develops at birth and children who inherit it only live until the ages of 3-5 since the disease destroys the body. Though this disease is rare it commonly appears in eastern european Jews.

                    <h3>Symptoms</h3> <br/>
                    <p>
                        Some symptoms may include being overly startled by noises and movement, being very slow to reach milestones like learning to crawl, and losing skills they have already learned, floppiness and weakness which keeps getting worse until they're unable to move, difficulty swallowing, loss of vision or hearing, muscle stiffness, and seizures. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Treatment or Cure</h3> <br/>
                    <p>
                        Although there is no cure, there is treatment. This treatment is called Palliative Care. Palliative care may include medication for pain, anti-epileptics to control seizures, physical therapy, feeding tubes, and respiratory care to reduce mucus buildup in the lungs. This mainly just keeps the person/child alive and somewhat comfortable for as longs as doctors can.

                    <h3>Diagnosis</h3> <br/>
                    <p>
                        The diagnosis of Tay-Sachs disease involves a blood test that detects absent or very low levels of beta-hexosaminidase.
